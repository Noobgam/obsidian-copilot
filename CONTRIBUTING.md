# Contributing to Copilot for Obsidian

Go to [Logan](https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).<br>
For now I am not likely to accept your contribution as my fork is in early stages.

If you really want to help, just submit any PR that passes lint/build/test with meaningful message.
